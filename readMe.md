SBA 308: Javascript code containing several if/else statements, loops with several inner loops to help pull data from AssignmentGroup and LearnerSubmissions and simplifying it into sections. The output isn't exactly the same to the sample output, I am missing the percentage of each individual learner ID assignments and for some reason the output isn't in order either (id,avg,1,2). The hardest part of this project was getting started and the loops get confusing for me and I had a hard time getting them to work properly.
